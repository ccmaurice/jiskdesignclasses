            <h2>Who I Am</h2>
            <p>Hi! I'm Mantasha, a passionate young chef and dreamer.</p>
            <img src="me cooking.jpeg" alt="Mantasha cooking in the kitchen" class="centered-image">
            <p>My culinary journey began at the age of 10, and I've been creating magic in the kitchen ever since. As a proud 10th grader, I find joy in crafting dishes that celebrate tradition and creativity, inspired by my rich Pakistani heritage and the vibrant memories of my childhood.</p>

            <p>Cooking isn't just a hobby for me; it’s a lifelong passion driven by the unwavering support of my parents—my backbone—and the encouragement of my loving grandma. My late grandpa, my true hero, continues to inspire me with his strength and resilience, reminding me to pursue my dreams with determination.
            My ultimate goal is to fulfill my dad's dream and mine by building a restaurant of my own, where flavors and culture blend to create unforgettable experiences.
            When I'm not cooking, I cherish spending quality time with my family, friends, and cousins, making candid videos, snapping pictures, and exploring life through competitions and adventures.
           This is where I share my story—a mix of passion, love, and a sprinkle of imagination. Welcome to my world!</p>
