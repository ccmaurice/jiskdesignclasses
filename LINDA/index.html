                <p>I have a passion for both science and creativity, which is the reason why I enjoy biology and designing. 
                    Creating something visually appealing is something that really brings me joy. Apart from that, I also have an interest in photography. 
                    Capturing moments that tell a story, or simply highlighting the simplicity of life, fuels my inspiration.
                     I also love music—it’s a source of endless relaxation and motivation for me. With a strong interest in medicine, 
                     I aspire to become an anesthesiologist, where I can combine my knowledge of biology with my desire to help others in critical moments.
